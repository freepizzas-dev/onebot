oneBot Privacy Policy
04/01/2022

Some features of oneBot require the collection and storage of data associated with your account. For example, when using the /weather command, you may choose to set a default weather location. This default location is stored and tagged with your account so that we can retrieve it in the future.

Data is stored in a secured sqlite database on a dedicated virtual server for this service. If you choose to stop using oneBot by removing him from your server, your data will be deleted after 90 days of inactivity.

Your data is always available for you to review. If you wish to see all data stored that is associated with your account, make a request at the oneBot support server, located at: https://discord.gg/cwWDVtCW3x

You may always request the deletion of any data associated with your account. We will honor all requests of this type.

No unnecessary data is gathered during your use of oneBot. Usage logs may be stored for debug and development purposes, or to investigate potential breaches of our Terms of Service.

Your data is available to the developers of oneBot ONLY, and NO data is ever shared with any third parties. Extensive efforts are made to secure data that we collect, but no guarantee is made. In the event of a data breach, users will be notified through the Discord service.
